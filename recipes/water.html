<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Water is the common name for dihydrogen monoxide or H2O. The molecule is produced from numerous chemical reactions, including the synthesis reaction from its elements, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hydrogen gas</li>
    <li>Oxygen gas</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix the two gases together.</li>
    <li>Add a spark or sufficient heat to provide the activation energy to start the reaction.</li>
    <li>Energy must be supplied to break the covalent bonds that hold H2 and O2 molecules together.</li>
